							<h2 class="fw-bold heading">What are Carbon Emissions?</h2>
							<p>
								To understand carbon emissions, we need to first refresh our knowledge of
								<span class="highlight"> the greenhouse effect. </span>
							</p>
							<p>
								The greenhouse effect is the natural process of how the sun warms the Earth’s surface.
								When greenhouse gases release into the atmosphere, they trap the sun’s heat, thus
								warming the average global temperature, causing it to rise. This is known as
								<span class="highlight">global warming.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								Some of these greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone,
								and water vapor. Among these, carbon emissions are crucial to our conversation because
								they are
								<span class="highlight"
									>the most significant type of emission in terms of quantity.</span
								>
							</p>
							<p>
								What causes these significant amount of carbon emissions are humans. Carbon dioxide gets
								released into the atmosphere after everyday human processes like driving a vehicle, the
								agricultural industry, and more.
								<span class="highlight">The Environmental Protection Agency</span> lists the six main
								sources of greenhouse gases as transportation, electricity production, industry,
								commercial and residential, agriculture, and land use and forestry.
							</p>
							<p>
								According to the
								<span class="highlight">Inventory of the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</span>,
								a report by the EPA, transportation accounted for 28.9 percent of all 2017 greenhouse
								gas emissions, the biggest culprit of all the categories.
							</p>

							<h2 class="mt-4 fw-bold heading">Are Carbon Emissions Pollution?</h2>
							<p>
								We have often heard more about "pollution" than compared to "carbon emissions", or even
								"greenhouse gases". But, essentially, carbon emissions are a form of pollution.
							</p>
							<p>
								According to <span class="highlight">National Geographic,</span> carbon dioxide is
								considered a pollutant. Although we may more readily associate pollutants with things
								like smoke or plastic floating in a lake, pollutants are actually anything that falls
								under the umbrella of a mix of particles and gases that have the capacity to reach
								harmful concentrations. Things like soot, smoke, mold, and pollen are considered
								pollutants, but greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide are, too.

							<h2 class="fw-bold heading">How Do Carbon Emissions Affect Us?</h2>
							<p>
								Carbon emissions affect the planet significantly, as they are the greenhouse gas with
								the highest levels of emissions in the atmosphere. This, of course, causes global
								warming and ultimately, <span class="highlight">climate change.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels — coal, natural gas,
								and oil — are burned. But burning other biological materials also releases carbon
								dioxide: solid waste, trees, etc. Anytime that carbon dioxide is emitted into the
								atmosphere in large quantities — especially if it’s staying in the atmosphere for
								thousands of years — it is affecting the planet.
							</p>
							<p>
								How do carbon emissions affect the planet? For starters,
								<span class="highlight">NASA</span> says that rising levels of carbon dioxide in the
								atmosphere will both hurt and help crops. While increased carbon dioxide levels can
								“increase water-use efficiency in crops” and also “mitigate yield losses due to climate
								change,” these levels can also create imbalances in nitrogen and carbon, minimizing
								crops’ necessary nutrients like iron, zinc, and protein.
							</p>
							<p>
								Perhaps the most important way that carbon emissions affect the planet is by causing
								climate change. As the average global temperature warms, our climate inherently changes
								— it warms.
								<span class="highlight">
									This warming causes extreme weather events like tropical storms, wildfires, severe
									droughts and heat waves.
								</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								While an increase in carbon in the air can, in some ways, positively affect plants and
								crops, if the climate changes the lands and causes drought or other weather events that
								crops and plants are unable to survive in, it can be detrimental to crop yields. The
								same problem holds for animals, as well; as climate change alters our environment and
								natural habitats, different indigenous species take a hit. Some species may disappear
								altogether, while others might thrive and overtake others.
							</p>

							<h2 class="mt-4 fw-bold heading">Are Carbon Emissions Dangerous?</h2>
							<p>
								Carbon emissions are dangerous in that they threaten the livelihood of our planet,
								animals, humans, and ultimately, life as we know it. Symptoms of climate change include
								melting of the polar ice caps, the rising of sea levels, the disturbance of animals’
								natural habitats, extreme weather events, and so many more negative side effects that
								are dangerous to the planet, to human and animal life, and to our future.
